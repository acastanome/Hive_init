/*
* 13: Name the command that find, in real time, currently running processes
*
* ps (process statuses) produces a snapshot of all running processes.
* Therefore, unlike the Windows task manager, the results are static.
*
* Without any argument or option: returns a list of running processes along with
* four crucial columns: the PID, terminal name (TTY), running time (TIME), and the
* name of the command that launches the process (CMD). For more info about your running processes:
*
* a option outputs all running processes of all users in the system.
* u option provides additional information like memory and CPU usage percentage,
* 	the process state code, and the owner of the processes.
* x option lists all processes not executed from the terminal. A perfect example of
* 	this are daemons, which are system-related processes that run in the background when the system is booted up.
*
* ps a : used in scripts and to pipe info, since top is changing
