* List all real users on the VM
*
* User accounts are given a numeric ID. Usually, regular human accounts start at 1000, and system, non-human, at 0.
* The ID of the root account is 0.
*
* Linux keeps track of the min and max values using configuration parameters called UID_MIN and UID_MAX,
* 		held in the “/etc/login.defs” file.
*	To find them: grep -E '^UID_MIN|^UID_MAX' /etc/login.defs

- Option 1, slow, checks all numbers:
  getent passwd {1000..60000}

- Option 2 (substitute 1000 and 60000 for the UID_MIN and UID_MAX respectively):
  awk -F: '{if ($3 >= 1000 && $3 <= 60000) print $1}' /etc/passwd
