* Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85
* 
* Rerouting won't change the destination IP, just redirect to it.
* NAT (Network Address Translation) changes the destination address, so when network traffic
* involves a specific network address (10.10.10.10), it gets translated to another address (20.20.20.20).
