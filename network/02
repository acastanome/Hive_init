# 02: Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics

# Ethernet is a way of connecting computers and other network devices in a physical space.
# This is often referred to as a local area network or LAN. The idea of an Ethernet network
# is that computers and other devices can share files, information and data between each other efficiently.

# (a): Identify broadcast address
# Broadcast address is an IP address where the host bits are set to 1.
# This address is used to transmit data to all of the hosts on the local subnet.
#
# awk NR to get the number of lines (rows), NF to get the number of columns and print the last

ifconfig | grep broadcast | awk 'NR==1 {print $NF}'



# (b): Identify all IP addresses which are part of the same subnet
#
# arp (Address Resolution Protocol) -a displays all
# Displays extra ip's from networking:
# 		   ping -c 2 $(ifconfig | grep broadcast | awk 'NR==1 {printf $NF}') > /dev/null && arp -a | awk -F"[()]" '{print $2}'

ifconfig | grep broadcast | awk 'NR==1 {print $NF}' && ping -c 2 $(ifconfig | grep broadcast | awk 'NR==1 {print $NF}') | grep time | awk -F" " '{print $4}' | sed 's/.$//' | sort | awk '!seen[$0]++'
