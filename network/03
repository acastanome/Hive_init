* 03: Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card
* Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique numeric identifier used to distinguish a device from others on a network. The address is assigned by the manufacturer, for Ethernet and Wi-Fi cards.

* On systems with both an ethernet and wireless connection, en0 will be your ethernet interface
* and en1 will be your wireless interface. A MAC address will be shown for both en0 and en1 and
* likely labelled as “ether”.
* On systems with just a wireless connection, en0 will be your wireless interface.
*/

/*
* Decided not to use because in some computers the Wi-Fi cards MAC address is en0
* ifconfig en1 | grep ether | awk '{printf $2}'
*/

/*
* grep -A shows N lines after matching pattern. -B N lines before, -C before and after.
