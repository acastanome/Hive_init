# Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process that enables one, unique IP address to represent an entire group of computers.
# In network address translation, a network device, often a router or NAT firewall, assigns a computer or computers inside a private network a public address.
# This allows a single device to act as an intermediary or agent between the local, private network and the public network that is the internet.
# NATâ€™s main purpose is to conserve the number of public IP addresses in use, for both security and economic goals.
